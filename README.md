### Lesson 04 : Understanding Ruby Variable and Concatenating

### What is a Variable?
Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

### Assigning Value to Variables
Naming variables is known as one of the most difficult tasks in computer programming. When you are naming variables, think hard about the names. Try your best to make sure that the name you assign your variable is accurately descriptive and understandable to another reader. Sometimes that other reader is yourself when you revisit a program that you wrote months or even years earlier.

When you assign a variable, you use the = symbol. The name of the variable goes on the left and the value you want to store in the variable goes on the right.

````ruby
first_name = 'Joe'
=> "Joe"
````

As you can see, we've now stored the string 'Joe' in memory for use throughout the program.

Note: Make sure you don't confuse the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==). The individual = symbol assigns value while the == symbol checks if two things are equal.

### String Concatenation:

String concatenation looks a lot like addition. When you use the + operator to join two strings together, you are performing a string concatenation.

Concatenation looks like this:

````ruby
a = "Nice to meet you"
b = ", "
c = "do you like blueberries?"

a + b + c

Output => "Nice to meet you, do you like blueberries?"
````
